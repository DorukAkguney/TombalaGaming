# Tombala Game Simulation Using MATLAB

## Project Description
This project simulates a tombola game using MATLAB. The game involves five players, each with a unique card containing 15 random numbers between 1 and 100. The goal is to simulate the drawing of numbers and track the progress of each player as they aim to achieve "cinko" and eventually complete the game. The program ensures the uniqueness of each player's card numbers and tracks the drawn numbers, updating the status of each player's card accordingly.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DorukAkguney/TombalaGaming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd TombalaGaming
    ```

## Usage
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Run the `TOMBALA.m` file.
3. The program will generate unique cards for each player and simulate the game, printing the results of each "cinko" and announcing the completion of the game for each player.

## Code Overview
- `TOMBALA.m`: The main MATLAB script that simulates the tombola game.
- `Tombala.pdf`: The project report detailing the methodology, implementation, and results of the simulation.
